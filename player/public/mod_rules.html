So you are thinking, how do I win that magnificent custom <b>laser-cut</b> gameboard?<br/>
Here's how: download the example bot in the language of your choice (<a href="./example_bots/java-example-bot.zip">Java</a>/<a href="./example_bots/cs-example-bot.zip">C#</a>/Python) and improve it to become the very best!<br/>
Our matchmaker will continually be pitting the latest bots against each other to determine the true <b>Master of Stones </b><br/>

<caption><strong>Let's start</strong></caption><br/>
<p>
To begin the game, White makes a move. This move <strong>must</strong> be a capture.<br/>
How to capture: pick one of your stones (of any type) and move it in one of 6 directions where the first stone is occupied by an opponent's piece. The opponent's piece is now removed from the game.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>2 moves per turn </b><br/>
<i>After White has started the game with only one move</i>, players always have two moves per turn.
The first move of any turn must always be a capture. <b>If you cannot capture, you lose!</b><br/>
After your first capture you can make another <i>capture</i>, <i>reinforce</i> or <i>pass</i>. 
Choose Wisely!

There are 3 different types of stones:<br/>
 <b>Pebbles, Rocks and Boulders</b>.<br/>
Each player starts with 15 Pebbles, 9 Rocks and only 6 Boulders.<br/>
<strong>Keep at last one of each type, or you lose!</strong><br/>

<p> <b>Capture</b><br/></p>
<p>
Any stone can capture another stone, as long as the other stone has not been reinforced to be stronger than the attacking stone.

<p> <b>Reinforce</b> </p>
<p> Instead of moving a stone onto an opponent's stone, you can also move it on one of your own stones to reinforce it!
The other stone will be removed from the board and its strength will be added to the reinforcing stone.

<p> <b>Pass</b> </p>
<p>Sometimes it is better to do nothing. <br/>
In that case, you can pass.
