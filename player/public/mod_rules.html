<caption><strong>Let's start</strong></caption><br/>
<p>
This year's challenge has 2 parts: macro and micro.<br/>
<b>Macro</b> is about strategy, determining where you want to send your ufo's, which planets to conquer, and buying new ufo's.</br>
<b>Micro</b> is about tactics, shoot down your <strikethrough>enemies</strikethrough> opponents and live to fight another day. </br>
You can even compete in teams!</br>
One person can handle the macro while the other focuses on the micro.</br>
However, it is up to you to figure out how to divide the awesome prize!</br>
